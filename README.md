# Cardapio

Software engineering project for the development of an online menu of food items for home delivery.

This project aims to develop a catalog of foods available on the web.

Nham nham! :p

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.1.

We are using [NG Bootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home) as the visual package for this project.

Remember to install all the dependencies using `npm install`, since it depends on Angular-cli and bootstrap.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server (using `-o` or `--open` will automatically open in your browser). Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
